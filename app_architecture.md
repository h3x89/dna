# Festival POS System Architecture

## Overview

This project defines a cloud-based architecture for a festival Point of Sale (POS) application that is highly available, secure, and supports offline transactions. Attendees can make purchases with virtual currency from a prepaid account, even without internet access, ensuring reliable transaction processing.

## User Requirements

- **Organizers**: Enable participants to use virtual currency via prepaid accounts (top-ups are managed by a third-party).
- **Attendees**: Make payments without internet dependency.
- **Reliability**: Confirm successful transactions without double charges.

## Architectural Requirements

1. **POS System**: Authenticate users via PIN, NFC, or QR code, with offline storage and cloud syncing capabilities.
2. **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS encryption between POS and cloud.
3. **API Gateway**: Manages traffic, security, and access.
4. **Load Balancer**: Distributes load to application servers to ensure scalability.
5. **Microservices Architecture**: Modular backend on AWS (Lambda/Kubernetes) for transaction processing, user management, and history tracking.
6. **Database**: Multi-region replication with high availability (DynamoDB or RDS).
7. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Performance and error tracking via CloudWatch or Prometheus.
8. **Security Practices**: IAM roles, data encryption, and regular security scans.
9. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managed with Terraform or CloudFormation.
10. **Automatic Scaling**: Scales with variable load during events.
11. **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region failover setup.

## Technical Goals

- Offline POS with secure local storage and cloud sync.
- Secure backend access via API Gateway and Load Balancer.
- Multi-region database with automatic failover.
- Real-time monitoring and alerting to maintain infrastructure health.
- Modular microservices to improve scalability and resilience.

## Proposed Solution

### POS System

- **Local Storage**: SQLite/Realm database for offline transactions.
- **Authentication**: PIN, NFC, or QR-based, with AES-256 encryption.
- **Data Sync**: Sync transactions to the cloud upon reconnection, avoiding duplicates.

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **API Gateway**: Manages traffic, enforces security, and connects POS devices to backend services.
- **Load Balancer**: Routes traffic to microservices, supports health checks, and handles SSL termination.
- **Microservices**: Stateless services for transaction processing, user management, and history tracking.
- **Database**: DynamoDB or Aurora with multi-region replication and strong consistency settings.
- **Security**: Granular IAM roles, encrypted data (TLS for transit), and vulnerability scanning.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for AWS resource and custom metric tracking.
- **Alerting**: CloudWatch alarms notify the team on key performance issues.
- **Logging**: Centralized logs via AWS Elasticsearch (OpenSearch) and CloudWatch.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD

- **Tools**: Terraform or CloudFormation for infrastructure; CodePipeline for CI/CD.
- **Benefits**: Consistent environment setup, automation, and version control.

### Scaling & Recovery

- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling for EC2 (EKS) or Lambda serverless scaling.
- **Failover**: Multi-region deployment with Route 53 DNS failover and regional data replication.

### Backup & Testing

- **Backups**: Stored in S3 with lifecycle management; long-term backups in Glacier.
- **Testing**: Automated unit, integration, and load testing; scheduled tests during peak times.

## Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

- **PCI DSS**: Secure payment processing if handling card data.
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Compliance with data regulations in operation regions.
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed logs for auditing.

## Conclusion

This architecture leverages AWS services and best practices to ensure secure, reliable, and scalable transaction processing. Attendees can make purchases, even offline, with high system availability and resilience.
